# Rick and Morty - Characters Book

## Description
As a long-time huge Rick&Morty fanboy, I felt the need to create a web UI for the amazing [API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/) created by [Axel Fuhrmann](https://axelfuhrmann.com/).

The browseable entities are:
- Characters
- Episodes
- Locations

They are nicely hyper-linked together, for you to discover more and more about the universe created by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon ❤️

### Technology
Not much, to be honest. It's a [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) JS app, styled by [Bulma](https://bulma.io/).

### Compiles and Run
```
npm install
npm run serve
```

Enjoy it!
